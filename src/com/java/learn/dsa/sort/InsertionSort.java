ðŸ”¹ What is Insertion Sort?

Insertion Sort works the way you sort playing cards in your hand.
You pick one card at a time (from unsorted part) and insert it into the correct position in the sorted part (on the left).

So, the array is divided into two parts:

Sorted (on the left)

Unsorted (on the right)

ðŸ”¹ Step-by-Step Example

Array: [5, 3, 4, 1, 2]

Step	Sortedpart	 Unsorted part	 Action
Start	[5]	         [3,4,1,2]	     First element considered sorted
Pass 1	[3,5]	     [4,1,2]	     Insert 3 before 5
Pass 2	[3,4,5]	     [1,2]	         Insert 4 between 3 and 5
Pass 3	[1,3,4,5]	 [2]	         Insert 1 at the beginning
Pass 4	[1,2,3,4,5]	 []	             Insert 2 between 1 and 3



ðŸ”¹ Key Points
Property	        Description

Algorithm Type	    Comparison-based
Time Complexity	    O(nÂ²) (worst & average), O(n) (best if already sorted)
Space Complexity	O(1) â€” in-place
Stable?	            âœ… Yes
Adaptive?	        âœ… Yes (fast for nearly sorted data)
Best for	        Small datasets or partially sorted data
